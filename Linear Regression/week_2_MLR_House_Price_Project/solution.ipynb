    "# 🏡 Project Portfolio Lab: Predicting House Prices (Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge & LASSO)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** `house_prices_portfolio.csv`    \n",
    "**Goal:** Build and understand linear models to predict house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Problem Statement\n",
    "A real-estate analytics team wants to estimate **house prices** in a city using property and neighborhood features. Your task is to:\n",
    "1. Explore the dataset and understand the relationships.\n",
    "2. Build a **Multiple Linear Regression** model and interpret results.\n",
    "3. Validate **assumptions** (linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality, multicollinearity, outliers).\n",
    "4. Apply **variable selection** and **regularization** (Ridge/LASSO) to improve generalization.\n",
    "5. **Persist** the best-performing model (save & load) for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This PPL mimics the workflow you'd follow in a real project and is perfect for your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ What you'll learn\n",
    "- Load and explore a dataset (EDA)  \n",
    "- Build a **Multiple Linear Regression** model (`LinearRegression`)  \n",
    "- Check basic assumptions with simple plots and tests  \n",
    "- Understand **overfitting vs. generalization** (train vs. test performance)  \n",
    "- Improve models with **Ridge (L2)** and **LASSO (L1)** regularization  \n",
    "- **Save** and **load** a trained model using `pickle`  "
